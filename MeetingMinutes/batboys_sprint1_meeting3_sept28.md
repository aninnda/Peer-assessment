### Discussion Points
- The front-end of the website was completed with the instructor and the student's login forms. 
- Decided to use python for the back-end and discussed about all the factors we have to take into account to make the back-end of the website, what tools to install to make it possible for us to code with python and learn it at the same time to make our website possible. 
- Created the text files for the student names, each student's information for the login page and everyone being able to see the formed teams that the server had to retrieve to validate the user's credentials, but later on we were planning on using sql for the database for the website retrieving the information needed.
