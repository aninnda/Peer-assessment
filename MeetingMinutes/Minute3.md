### Discussion
The front-end of the website was completed with the instructor and the student's login forms. Moreover, we were also discussing about all the factors we have to take into account to make the back-end of the website, what tools to install to make it possible for us to code with python and learn it at the same time to make our website possible. Plus, there were also things like creating the text files for the student names, each student's information for the login page and everyone being able to see the formed teams that the server had to retrieve to validate the user's credentials, but later on we were planning on using sql for the database for the website retrieving the information needed.  We have come to an agreement to use python for the functionality of the back-end of the website.
