Project description: 
For university team projects, a Peer Assessment System is intended to let students assess their teammates' performance and contributions using four main criteria: cooperation, intellectual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. In addition to encouraging accountability, the approach gives teachers and students insightful feedback on individual and team performance.
There are two primary users: the students and instructors.
